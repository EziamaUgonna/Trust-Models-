### Trust-Models- ReadMe

Welcome to the Trust-Models repository! This project contains implementations of various traditional models for detecting anomalies and attacks in Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). These models focus on trust model techniques to enhance the security and reliability of these critical systems.

### Introduction
With the increasing deployment of VANETs, IoT, and CAVs, ensuring the security and reliability of these networks is crucial. Trust models play a significant role in detecting and mitigating anomalies and cyber-attacks. This repository provides implementations of various trust models to facilitate research and development in this area.

### Models Included
This repository includes the following trust models:

- **Bayesian Trust Model** (`Bayesiantrust.py`)
- **Euclidean Distance Trust Model** (`Euclidean`)
- **Mahalanobis Distance Trust Model** (`Mahalanobis`)
- **Cosine Similarity Trust Model** (`cosine`)
- **Fuzzy Trust Model** (`fuzzy_trust`)
- **Game Theoretical Trust Model** (`gametheoritical`)
- **Pearson Correlation Trust Model** (`pearson_correlation`)
- **Reinforcement Learning Trust Model** (`reinf`, `reinforcement`)
- **Similarity-Based Trust Model** (`similarity`, `similarity.py`)
